          Hey there! Do you identify as a girl, are interested in or are currently pursing a CS major/minor, and go to NYU? LeadHer is the  a mentorship platform  where girls in CS @NYU partner up with a girl mentor (a junior, senior, or graduate under 25) from NYU for guidance on their career development. In a typically intimidating environment lacking a strong female presence, your journey towards independence and growth in this field just got bit smoother...
